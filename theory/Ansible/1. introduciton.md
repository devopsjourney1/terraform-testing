# Why configuration management
- Sysadmins used to manually SSH into machines and make the changes
- Used to depend on documentation. in reality documentation rarely gets updated, and any documenation you inherit is never very good
- Problem of how to rebuild a server exactly like your other ones
- This doesn't scale well for lots of servers or for companies that go through rapid change velocity
- More advanced changes may of including running a shell script, but they can get complex and become difficult to maintain
- The requirement for Idempotencey: the ability to run an operation which produces the same
result whether run once or multiple times

# Configuration Management
- Through these problems, configuration management is born

# Ideopotency

# Configuration Management tools
- Chef, Puppet, Salt, Ansible
