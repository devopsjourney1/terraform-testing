# Installation

## Mac
```
sudo pip install ansible
homebrew install ansible
```

## Windows
No native windows client for ansible, so either create a VM or you could try using WSL.


## Ubuntu Linux
```
sudo apt-add-repository -y ppa:ansible/ansible
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y ansible
```

```
ansible --version
```


# Learning Ansible
With ansible installing software on 1000 servers is identical installing it on one, 
so don't feel bad about just running a plabook locally or on a simple vagrant setup. 
this is how the best of us setup our playbooks before running them in production.
I will be demoing a setup on vagrant as well as how to do it on produciton systems.


# The Inventory File
Ansible uses inventory files to know which hosts to connect to.  
It is very similar to  the /etc/hosts file that machines use for name resolution.
When you run ansible playbooks, you provide an inventory file. Hosts are seperated into groups.

Here's an example of a basic inventory file
Here's an example of one showing that you can specify more then just IP/hostname.

Inventory files can also be in YAML format (example)

Although you could technically have a single inventory file,
you will likely have many different inventory files.

Common to have one for each of your environments, DEV/QA/Staging/Prod
Also common to have have simple ones like 'localhost'

# Ad Hoc + Modules

```
ansible localhost -a "hostname" -u <username>
ansible localhost -b -m apt -a "name=mongodb state=present"
ansible localhost -b -m service -a "name=mariadb state=started
ansible localhost -m stat -a "path=/etc/hosts"
ansible localhost -b -m git -a "repo=git://example.com/path/to/repo.git dest=/opt/myapp
```
